- HTML
- CSS
- Prisma

### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Use NextUI components for UI elements.
- Use NextJS server actions for API calls.
- Use NextJS server components for server-side rendering.
- Use NextJS client components for client-side rendering.
- Use NextJS API routes for API endpoints.
- Use NextJS middleware for server-side middleware.
- Use NextJS redirects for client-side redirects.
- Use NextJS dynamic routes for dynamic routes.
- Use NextJS dynamic imports for dynamic imports.
- Use NextJS dynamic metadata for dynamic metadata.
- Use NextJS dynamic SEO for dynamic SEO.
